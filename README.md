# Pipeline_MIPS_CPU
An assembly line CPU design scheme based on Logisim
This is a course design task that takes me a week. The design goal is to reduce the additional overhead of the pipeline is the number of clock cycles. The instruction set adopts the MIPS architecture to achieve complete data adventure processing, and to achieve relatively perfect control adventure processing based on dynamic prediction technology.
